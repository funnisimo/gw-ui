## Learn by Example

This manual is a interactive. Navigate to sections of the manual using the menu on the left side.

On each page, click on any example to modify its source and re-run it by clicking elsewhere.

**Note:** Examples in this manual use the `SHOW()` function, which is not a part of `gw-ui`. This helper function is available only in this Manual.

**Note:** The examples also use the `LOOP` variable, which is a global variable in this Manual. Omit this for your projects.

**Note:** The Manual is thankfully adapted from the **rot.js** Interactive Manual.
